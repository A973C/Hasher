Hasher is a set of JavaScript functions to control browser history for rich-media websites and applications.
It works as an abstraction of browsers native methods plus some extra helper methods, it also has the advantage of dispatching Events when the history state change across multiple browsers (since this feature isn't supported by all of them).

** This is a work on progress, no test was done yet. **

## Key Features ##

 - Get/Set Hash value.
 - Get/Set Page Title.
 - Basic history control (back/forward/go).
 - Helper methods for query string manipulation.
 - Event listener support.

## Why? ##

 - Browsers evolved since the other available solutions were created.
 - Some of the alternatives are way too complex, sometimes doing more things than you actually want it to do.
 - Source code of most of the solutions are way too cryptic making it impossible to customize it for your need or to debug it in case you find any issue.
 - Some of the solutions require extra markup and/or a blank HTML file to make it work.

## Goals ##

 - Be simple.
 - Work on the main browsers (IE6+, newest versions FF/Safari/Opera/Chrome).
 - Clean source code, making it easy to debug/customize/maintain.
 - Follow best practices/standards.
 - Standalone.

## Important ##

 - This code is released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
 - This tool will probably only be tested against valid HTML files, so make sure to always validate your HTML file.
 - Weird case scenarios like calling methods from inside (i)frame, wrong doctype, non-valid HTML file, plugins, 3rd party code, etc, **MAY** prevent script from working properly.   
 - **No proper test was done until now, bugs are expected, use it at your own risk.**
