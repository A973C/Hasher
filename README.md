Hasher is a set of JavaScript functions to control browser history for rich-media websites and applications.
It works as an abstraction of browsers native methods plus some extra helper methods, it also has the advantage of dispatching Events when the history state change across multiple browsers (since this feature isn't supported by all of them).



## Why? ##

 - Browsers evolved since the other available solutions were created.
 - Some of the alternatives are way too complex, sometimes doing more things automatically than you actually want it to do.
 - Source code of most of the solutions are way too cryptic making it impossible to customize for your need or to debug it in case you find any issue.
 - Some of the solutions require extra markup and/or blank files to make it work.
 - The HTML5 History API is awesome but some for some kinds of applications using the
   `location.hash` may still be the recommended solution for saving application state.



## Goals ##

 - Be simple.
 - Work on the main browsers (IE6+, newest versions of Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome).
 - Clean source code, making it easy to debug/customize/maintain.
 - Follow best practices/standards.
 - Fully unit tested.
 - Don't break application if for some reason `location.hash` can't be updated.
   (it should still dispatch `changed` signal at each `hasher.setHash()`)



## Dependencies ##

 - **This library requires [JS-Signals](http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/) to work.**



## Basic Example ##


### HTML ###

Include [JS-Signals](http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/) and **hasher** to your HTML file:

```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="signals.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="hasher.js"></script>
```

**IMPORTANT:** `signals.js` should be included before `hasher.js`. 


### JavaScript ###

```js
  //handle hash changes
  function handleChanges(newHash, oldHash){
    console.log(newHash);
  }
 
  hasher.changed.add(handleChanges); //add hash change listener
  hasher.init(); //initialize hasher (start listening for history changes)
  hasher.setHash('foo'); //change hash value (generates new history record)
```



## Routes: Using Hasher together with Crossroads.js ##

Hasher is only focused on providing a reliable and clear API for setting hash values and 
listening to hash state change event. If you need an advanced *routing* system
check [crossroads.js](http://millermedeiros.github.com/crossroads.js/). Both
were designed to work together easily:

```js
//setup crossroads
crossroads.addRoute('home');
crossroads.addRoute('lorem');
crossroads.addRoute('lorem/ipsum');
crossroads.routed.add(console.log); //log all routes

//setup hasher
hasher.initialized.add(crossroads.parse, crossroads); //parse initial hash value
hasher.changed.add(crossroads.parse, crossroads); //parse hash changes
hasher.init(); //start listening for history change
```


## How does it work? ##

Hasher will listen for the browser `onhashchange` event if it is supported (FF3.6+, IE8+, Chrome 5+, Safari 5+, Opera 10.6+)
or it will fallback to pooling the `window.location` on an interval to check if
hash value changed. On IE 6-7 it also uses an hidden iframe to trigger 
the history state changes (since updating the hash value won't do the trick). 
This is the same method used by most of the other available solutions like swfaddress, 
jQuery Address, YUI History, jqBBQ, Really Simple History, etc...

The main difference from the other solutions are the API, code structure and
the fact that it doesn't require jQuery/YUI/dojo/moootools/etc to work. It also
uses [JS-Signals](http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/) for the events which 
provides a sane way of handling events and some really useful advanced features.



## Documentation ##

Documentation is inside the `dist/docs` folder.



## Repository Structure ##

### Folder Structure ###

    dev       ->  development files
    |- build        ->  files used on the build process
    |- lib          ->  3rd-party libraries
    |- src          ->  source files
    |- tests        ->  unit tests
    dist      ->  distribution files
    |- docs         ->  documentation
    |- js           ->  javascript files

### Branches ###

    master      ->  always contain code from the latest stable version
    release-**  ->  code canditate for the next stable version (alpha/beta)
    dev         ->  main development branch (nightly)
    gh-pages    ->  project page
    **other**   ->  features/hotfixes/experimental, probably non-stable code



## Distribution Files ##

Files inside `dist/js` folder.

 * hasher.js : Uncompressed source code with comments.
 * hasher.amd.js : Uncompressed source code wrapped as an [asynchronous module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition) to be used together with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) or any other AMD loader.
 * hasher.min.js : Compressed code.

Documentation is inside the `dist/docs` folder.



## Building your own ##

This project uses [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) for the build process. If for some reason you need to build a custom version install Ant and run:

    ant compile

This will delete all JS files inside the `dist` folder, merge/update/compress source files and copy the output to the `dist` folder.

    and all

This will delete all files inside *dist* folder, run `ant compile` and generate documentation files.

**IMPORTANT:** `dist` folder always contain the latest version, regular users should **not** need to run build task.

## Important ##

 - Weird case scenarios like calling methods from inside (i)frame, wrong doctype,
   plugins, 3rd party code, etc, **MAY** prevent script from working properly. 
 - Hasher was designed on a way that it will still dispatch the 
   `changed` signal even if it can't update the browser `location.hash`, so 
   application should keep working even if back/prev buttons doesn't work as
   expected.
 - Consider using the new [HTML5 history API](http://robertnyman.com/2011/08/03/html5-history-api-and-improving-end-user-experience/)
   if normal URLs would make sense on the kind of site/application you are building and 
   you have static fallbacks for all of them (in some cases that may not be
   possible or even a good option). [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js) 
   is probably the most used *polyfill* for the History API, check it out.
